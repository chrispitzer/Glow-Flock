-Peal 5V off the other side of the capacitor array for the buck  boos power supply output
-Larger 5V traces to 5V pin headers. Need to handle a couple hundred mA.
-Silk screen and pin labels
-Do the pin headers fit straight into a 0.1" proto board?
-Larger trace and/or multi-layer trace to the 12V pin on the headers
-Do a more direct connection of 5V to the DEVKIT 5V pin. It's snaking thru the PCB and will have current draw issues and may brown out the level shifter.
-Will the barrel jack height interfere with our ability to plug a micro USB cable into the ESP32?
-Radius the inside corner of the diving board cutout. They have circular rotingbits and cant do square inside corners
-Consider rotation the solder landing strips 180 degrees so 12V is close to the 12V from the barrel connector
-Is the landing strip offset enough to allow for the micro usb plug to go into the ESP32?
-Radius the corners of the PCB as the corners of the case will have a small radius, and be less poky.
-Which side does the JST connector poke out from? By the barrel connector or by the antenna?
----The wires for the JST are going to go directly over the antenna. This may impact RF and/or cross couple 800khz with 2.4ghz signals. 
-How does the height stackup work with the sheilds? Super long pins? Receipticals onthe ESP-LED and long pins on the sheild?
-For the main 50pc production run, should we no-populate the pins for the shiled connections? Make those a manual add on for the primary batch?
-Some board houses have issues with vias thru pads and soldering processes. It may have DRC check errors. https://macrofab.com/blog/via-in-pad-pcb-design/

Good
-antenna diving board

Ideas:
-Extra space: maybe add extra solder pads for an additional JST connector???
-Extra Space: Add solder pads/vias for 12V in case you want to just solder wires to the 12v line.
